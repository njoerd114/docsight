# Contributing to DOCSight

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsDNNS/docsight.git
cd docsight
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest
```

## Docker Development

For a containerized dev environment:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

This runs on port **8766** (`http://localhost:8766`). Production uses `docker-compose.yml` on port 8765.

## Running Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

124+ tests cover analyzers, API endpoints, config, MQTT, i18n, and PDF generation.

## Running Locally

```bash
python -m app.main
```

Open `http://localhost:8765` to access the setup wizard.

## Internationalization (i18n)

Translations live in `app/i18n/` as JSON files:

- `en.json` — English
- `de.json` — German
- `fr.json` — French
- `es.json` — Spanish

Each file has a `_meta` field with `language_name` and `flag`. When adding or changing UI strings, update **all 4 files**.

## Before You Start

**Please open an issue first** before working on any new feature or significant change. This lets us discuss the approach and make sure it fits the project direction. PRs without a prior issue may be closed.

This is especially important for:
- New features or modules
- Architectural changes
- Changes touching multiple files

Small bugfixes and typo corrections are fine without an issue.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **One PR per feature/fix.** Don't bundle unrelated changes.
- **Keep changes focused and minimal.** Smaller PRs are easier to review and more likely to be merged.
- Add tests for new functionality
- Maintain all 4 language translations (EN/DE/FR/ES) in `app/i18n/*.json`
- Run the full test suite before submitting a PR
- AI-generated bulk PRs without prior discussion will not be merged

## Adding Modem Support

DOCSight currently supports AVM FRITZ!Box Cable routers. To add support for another modem:

1. Create a new module in `app/` (e.g., `app/arris.py`)
2. Implement `login()`, `get_docsis_data()`, and `get_device_info()` matching the FritzBox API
3. Return data in the same format as `fritzbox.get_docsis_data()` so the analyzer works unchanged
4. Update `main.py` to select the modem driver based on configuration
